> The nice thing here is that you do not need to provide a page title. The plugin will deduce the link text by applying the same logic that MkDocs uses for the main navigation. In fact, the syntax is the same as that of the nav section in the mkdocs.yml, so you can override the title if you want and even define subsections:
links:
  - Homepage: index.md
  - Blog index: blog/index.md
  - External links:
